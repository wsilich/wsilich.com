Hello! Iâ€™m William Silich, and I am a senior at Iowa State University. I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Cyber Security. Coding and security are my passions. I expect to graduate in Spring of 2024. Outside of class, I am currently the Vice President to our campusâ€™s cyber security club (IASG). This is my 3rd year with the club and the second as a cabinet member. Along with that, I enjoy participating in Cyber Defense Competitions that are put on by the university and even won the most recent ðŸŽ‰. For more information of that sort, feel free to check out my [resume](/resume/).

If you happen to find this site but didn't want to learn more about me, there are also [some games](/games/stocks/stoinks.html) set up. What kind of computer science student would I be otherwise?

This is an early version of my own site. So if you run into any unexpected issues, feel free to email me at [admin@wsilich.com](mailto:admin@wsilich.com).
