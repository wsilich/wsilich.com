### Overview:
During my Advanced Programming Techniques class (COM S 327) at Iowa State University, we had a semester long project that would create a RPG in the terminal using C and then later porting over and continuing with C++.


### Outcomes:
Over the course of this project, I learned how to use both C and C++ for the first time. This project was a great way to learn because it had a lot of code from map generation and path finding to user movement and battling. So, I implemented many algorithms that I had used in other classes in a non-memory managed language. This was definitely my favorite project at Iowa State as I was able to write code in a new way and also recreate one of my childhood games. 


Here is a snippet of the game in the terminal.
