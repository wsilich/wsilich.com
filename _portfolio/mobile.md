### Overview:

For this project-based class, our team was assigned to make an Android application with a Spring Boot backend. We decided to implement a racing game that would have players racing down a tack while avoiding obstacles. The backend of the project would be stored on a webserver, so that peopleâ€™s profiles and progress through the game could be tracked and stored across devices.


### Outcomes:

In the end, we were able to deliver a basic racing game that integrated nicely with a webserver. Coming into this project, I had the most experience with these types of frameworks, so I ended up as the team lead. I was primarily responsible for developing the backend during this project, so my focus would be learning this new framework. For me, this meant learning Spring Boot, which proved helpful during my summer internship a year later as it primarily used Spring Boot. I also spent time setting up our server for the database and backend to live. In addition, some people had little to no experience developing before, so I was able to help delegate the appropriate amount of work to everyone and also help them start developing in a new environment.
